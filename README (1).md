Welcome to the MicroMouse Maze Solver Project! This guide will help you understand the project and get it up and running in no time.

üìñ Project Overview
This project involves building and programming a MicroMouse robot to autonomously navigate through a maze using various algorithms.

üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
Here's a quick look at the project files:

/code: Contains the main code files for the MicroMouse robot.
/hardware: Information on the hardware components used.
/schematics: Circuit diagrams and connection schematics.
/documentation: Additional project documentation and resources.
README.md: This file, explaining how to set up and use the project.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your MicroMouse project up and running:

1. Gather the Required Components
You'll need the following components:

MicroMouse kit
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
Sensors (IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors)
Motors and wheels
Power supply
Breadboard and jumper wires

2. Clone the Repository
First, download the project files. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/micromouse.git
cd micromouse
```

3. Install the Arduino IDE
Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

4. Open the MicroMouse Code
Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to File > Open. Select the .ino file located in the /code directory of this project.

5. Connect the Components
Follow the schematics provided in the /schematics folder to connect your MicroMouse components to the microcontroller.

6. Upload the Code
Connect your microcontroller to your computer via USB. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port from the Tools menu. Then, click the upload button to upload the code to your microcontroller.

7. Test the MicroMouse
Once the code is uploaded, place your MicroMouse in the maze. Make sure all connections are secure and observe the robot's movements as it navigates the maze.
